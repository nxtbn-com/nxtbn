# 🔒 Security Guidelines for nxtbn

Welcome to the security guidelines for **Next Billion Native Commerce (nxtbn)**. This document outlines best practices for ensuring the security of your nxtbn deployment, as well as procedures for reporting security vulnerabilities.

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices
To maintain a secure environment, please follow these best practices:

- **Regular Updates**: Keep your nxtbn installation, dependencies, and server operating systems up to date. This ensures you have the latest security patches and features.

- **Secure Configurations**: Configure your servers and applications with security in mind. Use strong passwords, disable unused services, and employ firewalls and other security measures.
